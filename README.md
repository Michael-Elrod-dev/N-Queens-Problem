# N-Queens Solver

This program is a simple and efficient C++ implementation of the N-Queens problem solver. It uses a backtracking algorithm to find all possible solutions for placing N queens on an N x N chessboard, such that no two queens threaten each other.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you compile and run the N-Queens solver on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

To compile and run the program, you need a C++ compiler that supports the C++11 standard or later. The most common compilers are GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) and Clang.

### Compiling

To compile the program, navigate to the directory containing the source code file (`queens.cpp`) and run the following command:

```bash
g++ -o queens queens.cpp
